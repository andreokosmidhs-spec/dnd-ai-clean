# RPG Forge - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
RPG Forge is an AI-powered text RPG adventure application that allows users to create D&D-style characters and embark on AI-generated campaigns.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (CRA + Craco), TailwindCSS, Zustand, react-router-dom
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI**: OpenAI via emergentintegrations library

## Core Features

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Character Creation V2 (7-Step Wizard)
- Step 1: Identity (name, sex, age, appearance expression)
- Step 2: Race selection
- Step 3: Class selection with skill proficiencies
- Step 4: Ability Scores (standard array, point buy, or roll)
- Step 5: Background selection
- Step 6: Appearance customization
- Step 7: Review and confirm

#### Campaign Generation Flow
- Campaign draft creation with intent settings (tone, focus, scope, danger)
- AI-powered world generation via OpenAI
- Knowledge cards system (MTG-style card deck UI)
- Session bridge connecting Zustand store with legacy game engine

#### Campaign Log UI (MTG-Style)
- Filterable card grid with categories (Character, Location, Faction, Lore, Quest, Rumor)
- Card details drawer with pin functionality
- Responsive design with loading/empty states

### 🔄 In Progress
- None currently

### 📋 Backlog (Future Tasks)
- P2: Character Portrait upload/selection
- P3: Load/Edit Character functionality
- P3: Auto-calculate Hit Points based on class & Constitution
- P4: Ability scores display fix (shows defaults instead of selected values)

## Key API Endpoints
- `POST /api/characters/v2/create` - Create new character
- `GET /api/v2/characters/{id}` - Get character by ID
- `POST /api/campaigns/draft` - Create campaign draft
- `POST /api/campaigns/{id}/generate-world` - Generate AI world
- `GET /api/campaigns/{id}/log/cards` - Get knowledge cards

## Architecture Notes
- **State Management**: Hybrid system with Zustand (`useSessionCore`) and legacy useState in RPGGame.jsx
- **Session Bridge**: Critical `useEffect` in RPGGame.jsx syncs modern Zustand store with legacy game engine
- **Environment**: Backend requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` for campaign generation

## Changelog

### 2026-01-17
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed campaign generation flow returning to main menu
  - Root cause: `...characterData` spread in session bridge was overwriting extracted string values
  - Fix: Moved spread to beginning of object so extracted values take precedence
- **Verification**: Full end-to-end testing passed (100% backend, 100% frontend)
